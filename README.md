## Introduction

These scripts were used to perform parts of the machine learning, statistical analysis, and figure creation for this work.
This repository is submitted for transparency and so that others may use it as a resource.

## Description

The scripts in this repository orgnized into 4 steps of the workflow.
1. Transforms the predictor variables to make distributions more normal.
2. Z-scores (standardizes) the predictor variables.
3. Tunes, evaluates, and executes the machine learning models to generate predictions. One script for each model-element pair (e.g., MLP-S)
4. Generates maps and charts of the model predictions and statistics.

## Installation

To use the scripts in this repo, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local development system
2. Install the packages and dependences
The scripts require the following packages, although future versions may work also.
numpy           1.26.4
openpyxl        3.1.2
pandas          2.2.2
scipy           1.13.0
matplotlib      3.8.4
scikit-learn    1.4.2
Cartopy         0.22.0 (the following are dependencies of Cartopy)
geos            3.8.0
proj            9.3.1
pyproj          3.6.1
pyshp           2.3.1
shapely         2.0.1

Cartopy is the package use for making maps. It is recommended to use conda (instead of pip)
to install Cartopy. 

3. Set up and execute with your local Python environment

## Usage

Each script is executed individually in a step-wise sequential process.
Any user-defined inputs are defined as constants that can be altered.
The input to the first script is the master table (Master_table.xlsx).
